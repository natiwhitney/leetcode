Pythonic Leetcode Solutions and Explanations

## Raison D'etre
The purpose of this repository is to post solutions to a set of Leetcode problems that cover material most likely to be tested for in a standard FAANG interview, with an emphasis on problems that Netflix uses. Each solution will contain
- explanation of why this problem was selected (which classes of material it covers)
- document my thought process
- be written in idiomatic python
- contain a few unit tests
- address space/time complexity
- address limitations or alternative solutions
